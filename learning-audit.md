# Learning audit

## Frontend
### Key points

- Semantic HTML and Basic of CSS Layouts (RED)
- Flexbox, Grid (GREEN)
- DOM selectors (GREEN)
- Event listeners (GREEN)
- Forms (ORANGE) -> (GREEN)
- Fetch (GREEN)
- Async/Await (ORANGE) -> (GREEN)

### Learning plan

#### Forms 
I'm not sure what are use cases for attaching event listener to button or use form action property. 
I'm gonna build few forms to check different cases. 
#### Async functions
Still have problems in understanding how promises works. I will build small application using some async functions.
#### Event listeners
I feel confident with it but I want to try some more advanced stuff. I'm going to find some resources online and try to replicate them.

### UPDATE: Builded form using server actions in NextJS, used few async/await functions in personal project and used new event listeners like 'resize'

## Backend
### Key points
- CRUD functions (ORANGE) => (GREEN),
- Manipulating data (GREEN),
- Security (GREEN),
- Performance (ORANGE) => (GREEN),
- Designing API (ORANGE) => (GREEN),

### Learning plan

#### CRUD functions
I'm still a bit confused with POST and UPDATE so I'm going to build simple API to test and understand them.
#### Performance
Understand why and how we use async operations in API. I will practice using helper functions.
#### Designing API
Keep practicing building robust API and keep clean code

### UPDATE: Designed new API for personal project recapping and using new stuff I've learned

## Databases
### Key points 
- SELECTing query,
- Schema design,
- Relations between tables,
- JOINing tables,
- UPDATE query,
 ### Learning plan
 #### JOINing tables
