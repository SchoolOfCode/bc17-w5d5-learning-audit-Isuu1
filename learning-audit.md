## Frontend
### Key points

- Semantic HTML and Basic of CSS Layouts (RED) => (GREEN),
- Flexbox, Grid (GREEN),
- DOM selectors (GREEN),
- Event listeners (GREEN),
- Forms (ORANGE) -> (GREEN),
- Fetch (GREEN),
- Async/Await (ORANGE) -> (GREEN),

### Learning plan

#### Forms 
I'm not sure what are use cases for attaching event listener to button or use form action property. 
I'm gonna build few forms to check different cases. 
#### Async functions
Still have problems in understanding how promises works. I will build small application using some async functions.
#### Event listeners
I feel confident with it but I want to try some more advanced stuff. I'm going to find some resources online and try to replicate them.

### UPDATE: Builded form using server actions in NextJS, used few async/await functions in personal project and used new event listeners like 'resize'.

## Backend
### Key points

- CRUD functions (ORANGE) => (GREEN),
- Manipulating data (GREEN),
- Security (GREEN),
- Performance (ORANGE) => (GREEN),
- Designing API (ORANGE) => (GREEN),

### Learning plan

#### CRUD functions
I'm still a bit confused with POST and UPDATE so I'm going to build simple API to test and understand them.
#### Performance
Understand why and how we use async operations in API. I will practice using helper functions.
#### Designing API
Keep practicing building robust API and keep clean code

### UPDATE: Designed new API for personal project recapping and using new stuff I've learned.

## Databases
### Key points 

- SELECTing query (ORANGE) => (GREEN),
- Schema design (ORANGE) => (GREEN),
- Relations between tables (ORANGE) => (GREEN),
- JOINing tables (GREEN),
- UPDATE query (ORANGE) => (GREEN),

### Learning plan
 
#### JOINing tables
Confused with OUTER, LEFT and RIGHT join. Going to practice with simple database with two tables.
#### Schema design
Going to practice building database with proper design and relations
#### UPDATE query 
Sometimes I'm still confused with updating item in database and providing proper body.

### UPDATE: Created and designed PostgreSQL database advanced schema for side project with features like unique fields and many relations between tables.

## Quality Assurance Engineer
### Key points 

- Testing Tools (Concepts and Technical) (ORANGE),
- Test-driven Development (GREEN),
- End-to-end Testing (GREEN),
- API Testing (GREEN),

### Learning plan

### Key points 

- REACT and NextJS basics (GREEN),
- Components (GREEN),
- Routing (GREEN),
- Hooks (ORANGE),
- Reducer (ORANGE),
- State Context (GREEN),
- NextJS routes and API (ORANGE)

### Learning plan

#### UseEffect hook
Need to practice this couple times and make sure to understand how cleanup works.

#### Reducer 
I will build an application or refactor one of my projects to use Reducer with State Context (already have an issue opened in project board).

#### NextJS Authentication
I want to understand how create proper routes for user authentication 

## Product Manager
