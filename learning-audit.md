### Learning plan

#### Forms 
I'm not sure what are use cases for attaching event listener to button or use form action property. 
I'm gonna build few forms to check different cases. 
#### Async functions
Still have problems in understanding how promises works. I will build small application using some async functions.
#### Event listeners
I feel confident with it but I want to try some more advanced stuff. I'm going to find some resources online and try to replicate them.
